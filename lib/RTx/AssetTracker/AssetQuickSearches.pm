=head1 NAME

  RTx::AssetTracker::AssetQuickSearches - a pseudo-collection for SavedSearch objects.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RTx::AssetTracker::AssetQuickSearches;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  SavedSearches is an object consisting of a number of SavedSearch objects.
  It works more or less like a DBIx::SearchBuilder collection, although it
  is not.

=head1 METHODS


=cut

package RTx::AssetTracker::AssetQuickSearches;

use RTx::AssetTracker::AssetQuickSearch;

use strict;
use base 'RT::Base';

sub new  {
    my $proto = shift;
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;
    my $self  = {};
    bless ($self, $class);
    $self->CurrentUser(@_);
    $self->{'idx'} = 0;
    $self->{'objects'} = [];
    return $self;
}

=head2 LimitToPrivacy

Takes two argumets: a privacy string, of the format "<class>-<id>", as
produced by RT::SavedSearch::Privacy(); and a type string, as produced
by RT::SavedSearch::Type().  The SavedSearches object will load the
searches belonging to that user or group that are of the type
specified.  If no type is specified, all the searches belonging to the
user/group will be loaded.  Repeated calls to the same object should DTRT.

=cut

sub LimitToPrivacy {
    my $self = shift;
    my $privacy = shift;
    my $type = shift;

    my $object = $self->_GetObject($privacy);

    if ($object) {
	$self->{'objects'} = [];
	my @search_atts = $object->Attributes->Named('SavedSearch');
	foreach my $att (@search_atts) {
	    my $search = RTx::AssetTracker::AssetQuickSearch->new($self->CurrentUser);
	    $search->Load($privacy, $att->Id);
	    next if $type && $search->Type ne $type;
	    push(@{$self->{'objects'}}, $search);
	}
    } else {
	$RT::Logger->error("Could not load object $privacy");
    }
}

### Accessor methods

=head2 Next

Returns the next object in the collection.

=cut

sub Next {
    my $self = shift;
    my $search = $self->{'objects'}->[$self->{'idx'}];
    if ($search) {
	$self->{'idx'}++;
    } else {
	# We have run out of objects; reset the counter.
	$self->{'idx'} = 0;
    }
    return $search;
}

=head2 Count

Returns the number of search objects found.

=cut

sub Count {
    my $self = shift;
    return scalar @{$self->{'objects'}};
}

### Internal methods

# _GetObject: helper routine to load the correct object whose parameters
#  have been passed.

sub _GetObject {
    my $self = shift;
    my $privacy = shift;

    return RTx::AssetTracker::AssetQuickSearch->new($self->CurrentUser)->_GetObject($privacy);
}

### Internal methods

# _PrivacyObjects: returns a list of objects that can be used to load saved searches from.

sub _PrivacyObjects {
    my $self        = shift;
    my $CurrentUser = $self->CurrentUser;

    my $groups = RT::Groups->new($CurrentUser);
    $groups->LimitToUserDefinedGroups;
    $groups->WithMember( PrincipalId => $CurrentUser->Id,
                         Recursively => 1 );

    return ( $CurrentUser->UserObj, @{ $groups->ItemsArrayRef() } );
}

1;
